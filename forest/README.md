## 🌳 Inspiration

A couple years ago together with my friends I took a part in a programming competition. The objective was to build a mobile app that solves a global problem. We didn't win, but the app we built quickly spreaded in our families.

## 🥕 Features

<br />

- Track the step count, burned calories, distance travelled and CO₂ saved
- Get rewarded by completing your daily goal and keep motivated
- Use a handful notification with your daily stats updated live
- View a daily history of your progress
- View a detailed summary of your all-time progress

## 🐻‍❄️ Instalation and First Launch

1. Download the latest prebuilt binary (.apk file) from [Releases](https://github.com/bk20dev/forest/releases)
2. Run the downloaded file and temporarily allow instalation from unknown sources if prompted (turn it back off after installation).
3. Click "Install" and wait for the app to install.
4. On some devices you may encounter a Play Protect warning, but don't worry - this app is safe to use. I'm just an unverified developer (sorry).
5. You are good to go 🚀.

🚨 **Heads up!** On most devices you'll need to **turn off the app battery optimizations** for the app to count steps accurately. Forest uses a minimal amount of power and it won't impact your battery life.
